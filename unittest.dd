$(SPEC_S Unit Tests,

$(GRAMMAR
$(GNAME UnitTest):
	$(B unittest) $(GLINK2 function, FunctionBody)
)

	$(P Unit tests are a series of test cases applied to a module to determine
	if it is working properly. Ideally, unit tests should be run every
	time a program is compiled.
	)

	$(P Unit tests are a special function defined like:)

------
unittest {
  ...test code...
}
------

	$(P There can be any number of unit test functions in a module,
	including within struct, union and class declarations.
	They are executed in lexical order.
	Stylistically, a unit test for a function should appear immediately
	following it.
	)

	$(P A compiler switch, such as $(DPLLINK dmd-windows.html#switches, $(B -unittest))
	for $(B dmd), will
	cause the unittest test code to be compiled and incorporated into
	the resulting executable. The unittest code gets run after
	static initialization is run and before the $(D main())
	function is called.
	)

	$(P For example, given a class Sum that is used to add two values:)

------
class Sum {
  int add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }

  unittest
  {
    Sum sum = new Sum;
    assert(sum.add(3,4) == 7);
    assert(sum.add(-2,0) == -2);
  }
}
------

<h3>Versioning</h3>

	$(P The $(DDSUBLINK version, PredefinedVersions, version identifier)
	$(B unittest) is predefined if the compilation
	is done with unit tests enabled.

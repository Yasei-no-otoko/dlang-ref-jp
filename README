* What is this?

Japanese translation of D Programming Language spec (dlang.org).
The running website is at: http://www.kmonos.net/alang/d/.

* Milestone

For each release of dmd, I target to sync to the version.
Current milestone is dmd v2.059, the following revision:
https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/d-programming-language.org/tree/948c9b0856ba072d3b25e72c4f7191657cbf0eee

* Contributions

Any help is welcome!
- For minor typo or mistranslation, just ping me @kinaba on Twitter,
  or log in to github and use the "Improve this site" button on the translated pages.
- For a new/revised/improved translation of a full document,
  please send a pull request. There's one request for the translation:
  "align the line number with the original English document". Line numbers
  are used as meta data to sync English and Japanese texts.
- If you are interested in continuously volunteering in the translation,
  again, please ping me @kinaba at Twitter.

* TODO

- Translate intro-to-datetime.dd.
- Translate changelog.dd (= migrate the old translation to .dd based workflow).
- Translate druntime (= migrate the old translation to .dd based workflow).
- Translate phobos (= migrate the old translation to .dd based workflow).
- Add $(GLINK3 ...) macro to translate gramatical notions.
- Come up with a good methodology to merge the changes in English document.
- Generate in other formats (chm, pdf, ebook, ...).
- Move the site to more github friendly, community maintainable place.

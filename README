Started moving the Japanese translation of D Programming Language Website
  http://www.kmonos.net/alang/d/
to github, and translation on DDoc, not directly on HTML.
(Still thinking about how to translate Phobos documents, though...)

Currently, I have only set up the repository.
I will port the translation to DDoc soon.

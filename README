* Contributions

Any help is welcome!
 - For minor typo or mistranslation, just ping me @kinaba on Twitter,
   or log in to github and use the "Improve this site" button on the translated pages.
 - For a new/revised/improved translation of a full document,
   please send a pull request. There's one request for the translation:
   "align the line number with the original English document". Line numbers
   are used as meta data to sync English and Japanese texts.
 - If you are interested in continuously volunteering in the translation,
   again, please ping me @kinaba at Twitter.

 - Translate druntime (= migrate the old translation to .dd based workflow).
 - Translate phobos (= migrate the old translation to .dd based workflow).

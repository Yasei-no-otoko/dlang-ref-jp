* What is this?

Japanese translation of D Programming Language
  http://www.kmonos.net/alang/d/
was suspended from spring 2011.
Now I am rebooting it and catching up the latest version (dmd v2.059).

Changes from the old workflow is:
 - Translate .dd files, not .html files.
 - Move repository to public github.
 - D1 refernce will not be updated any more.
 - (For now) Phobos reference is not maintained.
   I will think about Phobos after catching up D 2.059.

* Milestone

For each release of dmd, I'd like to sync up to the version.
Current milestone is dmd v2.059, the following revision:
https://github.com/D-Programming-Language/d-programming-language.org/tree/948c9b0856ba072d3b25e72c4f7191657cbf0eee

* Contributions

I welcome any help!
If you were interested in translation, just do it and please send a pull request.
  (One request: please do not change the line numbers while translation.
   It makes merging of the updates in original English version much easier.)
Or ask me @kinaba at Twitter.
